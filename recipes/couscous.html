    <h1>Couscous</h1>
    <img src="../images/Couscous.jpg">
    <h2>This is a famous traditional Moroccan dish. Couscous is made of semolina, traditionally it is prepared by being steamed in a food steamer called a <em>kiskas.</em> 
        The base of the kiskas contains the meat and vegetables that are cooked as a stew and on the top it contains the steamer which absorbs the flavours from the stew.
        The broth from the stew is then used to keep the couscous moist. This is a very delicious and healthy dish. Proper Moroccan couscous takes time to prepare but fortunately
        we have a quick recipe to make your own.
